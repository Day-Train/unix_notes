SSH
	syntax:
		$ssh username@servernamename
		$ssh username@192.0.0.1
		$ssh servername --> will use your current username e.g.  if I'm 'alex' on client machine it will attempt alex@servername
		$ssh -p <port #> username@servernamename
		Ctrl-D --> logout
	configuration
		openssh-server
		/etc/ssh/sshd_config
	public/private keygeneration
		(client) ssh-keygen -t rsa [-b 4096]
		(client) enter pretty strong passphrase
		(client --> server) need to copy public key (.pub) to server device
			scp [path]/id_rsa.pub username@clientname:/[server path]
		(server) ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (make sure chmod 700!)
		(server) cp id_rsa.pub --> authorized_keys (or echo into it for multiple keys)
		(server) In order to turn off Password Auth
			1. ChallengeResponse... --> no
			2. PasswordAuthentic... --> no
			3. UsePam... --> no
			(BONUS! set listening port to 443 or 80)
		(server) sudo service ssh restart
SOX Proxy
	Per above --> enable ssh and browser settings (in Firefox Advanced->Network->Settings->Manual Proxy)
	Setup Tunnel 
		--> (client) ssh -N (no loging) -D (bind to port) 8080 username@servername -p (server port) 22
		--> (server) Browser set to SOCKS Host 127.0.0.1 port 8080
SSH Aliases
	/etc/ssh/ssh_config --> general client config (NOT the same as sshd_config)
	can create a separate user config file 
		--> .ssh/config (may not exist by default)
	man ssh_config
Networking
	$ifconfig --> display network interfaces, from the perspective of their software 
		confgiuration, defaults to exclude down interfaces
		$ifconfig -a --> display all network interfaces, including down
		$ifconfig <name> --> display information about particular network interface
	$ethtool <name> --> display information about the named hardware device
		supported link modes: support transfer rates (e.g. 100baseT = 100Mb/s)
		link partner advertised link modes: as above for partner
		speed: the maximum transfer rate supported by both the link and partner
		link detected: is it plugged in?
	$iwconfig --> configure wireless interfaces
	$ethtool -s <key1> <value1> <keyn> <valuen> --> configure device (e.g. ethtool -s 
		speed 100 duplex full)
	Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - IPv4 protocol to map network IP address to hardware
		 addresses
		--> When you connect (i.e. ssh) into an IP address that has to be resolved to a 
			hardware (physical) address. ARP does this.
