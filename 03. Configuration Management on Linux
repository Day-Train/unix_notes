Ansible
	0. Requirements
		1. Local and target machines must have ansible and openssh-server installed. Local
			machine must be able to ssh into target host.
		2. Ansible has a default host inventory in /etc/ansible/hosts file
			This will (commonly) be reconfigured for a local project/playbook
		3. Privileges
			a. Many tasks require elevated privileges (ex. sudo). You can either enable a passwordless user on the target machine or...
			b. use the Ansible vault option by
				i. include in your playbook yaml:
					vars_files
						- secret
				ii. enable an encrypted secret file and enter a password when prompted
					$ansible-vault create secret
					#You can edit this later with ansible-vault edit secrete
				iii. create a file vault.txt and place password into file
				iv. Run your playbook with additional arguments as follows
					$ansible-playbook playbook.yml -u username -i hosts --ask-become-pass --vault-password-file=vault.txt
				appendix. sample directory layout
					.
					|_playbook.yml
					|_secret
					|_hosts
					|_vault.txt
	1. Executing ad-hoc commands via ansible
		$ansible <hosts> [-m module]
			--> execute some module against hosts
			--> hosts can be either the default /etc/... file or specified directly using
				the [-i /Path/To/File]
			--> modules accomplish tasks. Typically there are modules with mirror command-line
				tools.
					ex. $ansible <hosts> -m ping --> ping host(s)
					ex. $ansible <hosts> -m shell -a 'apt-get install tmux' --> execute shell with argument
