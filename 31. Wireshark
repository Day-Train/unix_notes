# View only packets that match my expression
[ws]> dns.qry.name contains "www.evil.com"      # Search for specific field for match
[ws]> frame contains "www.evil.com"             # Search entire frame for match

# Difference between "Contains" and "Find Packet"
# Contains limits view to only packets, good for filtering and isolating
# Find Packet does not limit view, good for seeing data in context

# Use REGEX
[ws]> dns.qry.name matches "^www"

# Creating Filters #
####################

Option 1:
# Create display filters through the GUI using "Analyze" --> "Display Filter Expression..."

Option 2: 
# Use autocomplete as you type out the protocols you're interested in...

Option 3:
# Any field, value, etc. you can select you can right click you can use the "Apply as Filter" menu option

# Consider "Prepare as Filter" to create your expression without applying it, whereas "Apply as Filter" does total processing and can be more expensive
